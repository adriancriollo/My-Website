            <div>I am currently in my 3rd year at Northeastern pursuing a Bachelors of Science in a combined major of
                Computer Science and Computer Engineering.
                Some relevant courses include, up to Calculus 3, Circuits & Signals, Algorithms & Data, Fundamentals of
                Networks, and Computer Systems. I am aiming for a graduation date in Decemeber 2024.

            <div>Software Developer</div>
            <div>During my time at NAM, I developed and implemented a comprehensive suite of automated testing using
                Jest
                and Node. This ensured optimal functionality and reliability for client websites.
                Additionally, I led an in-depth evaluation of a client's cryptography module, focusing on: validating
                its
                robustness and reliability,
                generating and testing various digital certificates for system compatibility and compliance,
                creating Intermediate Certificate Authorities (ICAs) to check hierarchy and delegation protocols,
                ensuring secure and streamlined certificate issuance, and
                producing and facilitating the approval process for Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) to confirm
                system
                responsiveness and reliability.

            <div>Project Manager</div>
            <div>At CDP, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a talented team of project managers on a significant
                project, overseeing the migration of CRM systems.
                In my role, I executed strategies and improvements to project plans using Workfront which result in
                increasing tema efficiency by 50%. Furthermore, I researched and implemented new technologies
                to the current strategy of project management to save 30+ hours of work weekly. Lastly, I generated and
                presented performance and progress reports, using Excel and Workfront, on over 7 departments and 50+
                employees ranging from Digital Services to Business Operations.

            <div>Project Deployment Lead</div>
            <div>Over two years at CTS, I led the configuration and deployment of 8,000+ devices across 60+ schools in
                the
                New York area, leveraging G-Suite & PDQ Deploy.
                Starting as an intern, I adeptly addressed IT issues, consistently achieving 100% client satisfaction
                during
                site visits. In collaboration with senior engineers,
                I contributed to the network infrastructure development for 5+ schools. I was later promoted to Project
                Lead, managing a team of six interns, effectively delegating tasks and ensuring smooth project
                execution.

            <div>Mini Shell</div>
            <div>Course Project - Computer Systems</div>
            <div>I successfully constructed a fully functional UNIX shell utilizing the C programming language. Within
                this
                development, I integrated support for key features such as I/O redirection, piping, sequences, and
                background processes.
                Furthermore, I harnessed 'malloc' to craft a custom string manipulation library, ensuring efficient
                tokenization of arguments.

            <div>Maze Game</div>
            <div>Course Project - Fundamentals Of Computer Science 2</div>
            <div>Working collaboratively in a pair-programming setting, I co-developed a Maze game using Java. This game
                leveraged advanced graph structures and incorporated intricate graph algorithms, notably Kruskal’s
                algorithm. Throughout the development process, we upheld coding best practices, emphasizing abstraction.
                Additionally, we integrated diverse testing methodologies, including the implementation of random
                testing,
                to ensure game robustness and functionality

            <div>Piezoelectric Wheel</div>
            <div>Course Project - Cornerstone of Engineering</div>
            <div>I designed an innovative wheel embedded with piezoelectric sensors, which, as it rotated, generated
                voltage
                to charge a battery.
                To visualize and refine this invention, I crafted a detailed 3D model using SolidWorks. Further
                emphasizing
                the wheel's functionality, I developed a C++ program to meticulously analyze its voltage output.
                Recognizing the significance and innovation of this work, it was nominated for presentation at the
                esteemed
                ASEE 2022 Conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
